                      general-purpose level-1 skill called 'Do anything' and one or two

                      control panel, you get to roll three dice and add them

                      skill (let's say you have 'firearms: 3') then you'll have

                      originally used. Let's say your PC with the firearms skill
                      used their 'do anything: 1' skill to fix a control panel

                      yet another even more specific skill at level-3, perhaps
                      'repair electrical devices: 3'. So from then on, if the
                      thing you were repairing was an electrical device, you
                      would get to roll three dice... though before you could
